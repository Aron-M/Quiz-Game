* Final page shows a congratulations message and also *should* display the user's final score.
* At the bottom, the 'back to home' button will redirect the user back to the home page.
* Notice that 'back to home' button wil turn black when hovered over.

### ERROR!
* On the right hand side screenshot of final page you will see there is no score displayed.
This is because I was not able to figure out how to do it. JavaScript is still too dificult for me and I ran out of time trying to figure out everything I needed to do for this project.

## TESTING

As shown previously, there was a big bug regarding the final score not showing

* I have since done extensive research and figured out how to add the final score.
* Validation has been done on both the CSS, with W3Schools, and for JavaScript with JSHint
* On this occasion there is no known bugs and all validators show that the code is running without any errors.


#### VALIDATOR

<img src="assets/images/w3s-validator-page.png" alt="validator-page" />

Validator JSHint shows no errors however only two warnings of unused functions.
